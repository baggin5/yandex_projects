Investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund have decided to open a public catering establishment in Moscow.
The clients are unsure about the direction of the establishment (cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, pub, or bar), its location, and pricing.
The task is to prepare a market research study of public catering in Moscow, identify interesting features, and present the findings that will assist the investors in choosing a suitable location in the future.
